# Procedural generation of cell images and their holograms
This repository contains a Python-based framework for **synthetic generation of cell-like objects and their holographic representations**. The code is primarily intended for creating **controlled, reproducible datasets** that can be used for testing image processing algorithms and training neural networks for detection, localization, and analysis of microscopic objects.

## Overview

The notebook implements a full pipeline for:

- Procedural generation of synthetic cell structures  
- Modeling of different cell morphologies  
- Addition of spatial noise  
- Numerical simulation of Fresnel diffraction  
- Visualization and animation of generated optical fields and images  

The generated data can be used as a substitute or supplement to experimental datasets, especially in cases where **precise ground truth information** is required.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`  
- `scipy`  
- `opencv-python`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `perlin-numpy`  

Make sure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
